# Mc-Coords

A [Paper MC](https://papermc.io/) plugin to save and share coordinates with your minecraft buddies.

## Commands

```

### Delete/Edit a coordinate

Not yet implemented sorry

## FAQ that no one asked, but I feel like answering

### Which versions of minecraft does this support?

I only tested in 1.18.2 and I stated that in the `plugin.yml` file.

### How do I install this?

Compile this into a Jar and put that Jar into the `plugins` directory of your spigot/paper server. I wish I could
provide more detail but I don't do Java (I swear!) and I don't really understand what I am doing with the tooling half
of the time.
